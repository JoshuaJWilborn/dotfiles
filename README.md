# Dotfiles

Most of these are self explanatory.  You can easily install these dotfiles and you should have Vim working as a IDE right off with autocomplete etc for at least typescript/javascript.

If you want to also install all the packages I use in an install, you can use the install.sh script which will install all packages (using pacman, so Arch distros) and install dotfiles etc.

If you only want to see a list of the packages required, view the .packages file.

Sorry if things are a bit messy, I don't have much time to tidy these up.  I hope someone finds these useful!
