# Dotfiles

Most of these are self explanatory.  You can easily install these dotfiles and you should have Vim working as a IDE right off with autocomplete etc for at least typescript/javascript.

If you want to also install all the packages I use in an install, you can use the install.sh script which will install all packages (using pacman, so Arch distros) and install dotfiles etc.

To use the install script call it like `sudo -u $USER install.sh`

If you want to call it directly from terminal without pulling repo first: `sudo -u $USER bash $(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joshuajwilborn/vim/master/install.sh)`

If you only want to see a list of the packages required, view the .packages file.

Sorry if things are a bit messy, I don't have much time to tidy these up.  I hope someone finds these useful!
